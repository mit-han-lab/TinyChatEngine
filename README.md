# TinyChatEngine: On-Device LLM Inference Library

Running large language models (LLMs) on the edge is useful: copilot services (coding, office, smart reply) on laptops, cars, robots, and more. Users can get instant responses  with better privacy, as the data is local.

This is enabled by LLM model compression technique: [SmoothQuant](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/smoothquant) and [AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization)](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/llm-awq), co-designed with TinyChatEngine that implements the compressed low-precision model. 

Feel free to check out our [slides](assets/slides.pdf) for more details!

## Overview
### LLM Compression: SmoothQuant and AWQ
[SmoothQuant](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/smoothquant): Smooth the activation outliers by migrating the quantization difficulty from activations to weights, with a mathematically equal transformation (100\*1 = 10\*10).

![smoothquant_intuition](assets/figures/smoothquant_intuition.png)

[AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization)](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/llm-awq): Protect salient weight channels by analyzing activation magnitude as opposed to the weights.

## Backend Support

| Precision | x86<br /> (Intel/AMD CPU) | ARM<br /> (Apple M1/M2 & RPi) | Nvidia GPU | Apple GPU |
| ------ | --------------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| FP32   |  âœ…    |    âœ…  |         |
| W4A16  |      |      |  âœ…  | âœ…
| W4A32  |  âœ…  |  âœ…  |      | âœ…
| W4A8   |  âœ…  |  âœ…  |      |
| W8A8   |  âœ…  |  âœ…  |      |

- For Raspberry Pi, we recommend using the board with 8GB RAM. Our testing was primarily conducted on Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.4 with aarch64. For other versions, please feel free to try it out and let us know if you encounter any issues.
- For Nvidia GPU, our CUDA backend can support Nvidia GPUs with compute capability >= 6.1. For the GPUs with compute capability < 6.1, please feel free to try it out but we haven't tested it yet and thus cannot guarantee the results.

## Quantization and Model Support

The goal of TinyChatEngine is to support various quantization methods on various devices. For example, At present, it supports the quantized weights for int8 opt models that originate from [smoothquant](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/smoothquant) using the provided conversion script [opt_smooth_exporter.py](llm/tools/opt_smooth_exporter.py). For LLaMA models, scripts are available for converting Huggingface format checkpoints to our int4 wegiht [format](llm/tools/llama_exporter.py), and for quantizing them to specific methods [based on your device](llm/tools/model_quantizer.py). Before converting and quantizing your models, it is recommended to apply the fake quantization from [AWQ](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/llm-awq) to achieve better accuracy. We are currently working on supporting more models, please stay tuned!

### Device-specific int4 Weight Reordering

To mitigate the runtime overheads associated with weight reordering, TinyChatEngine conducts this process offline during model conversion. In this section, we will explore the weight layouts of QM_ARM and QM_x86. These layouts are tailored for ARM and x86 CPUs, supporting 128-bit SIMD and 256-bit SIMD operations, respectively. We also support QM_CUDA for Nvidia GPUs, including server and edge GPUs.

| Platforms  | ISA | Quantization methods |
| ------------- | ------------- |  ------------- |
| Intel & AMD |  x86-64  | QM_x86  |
| Apple M1/M2 Mac & Raspberry Pi | ARM | QM_ARM  |
| Nvidia GPU| CUDA | QM_CUDA  |

- Example layout of QM_ARM: For QM_ARM, consider the initial configuration of a 128-bit weight vector, \[w0, w1, ... , w30, w31\], where each wi is a 4-bit quantized weight. TinyChatEngine rearranges these weights in the sequence  \[w0, w16, w1, w17, ..., w15, w31\] by interleaving the lower half and upper half of the weights. This new arrangement facilitates the decoding of both the lower and upper halves using 128-bit AND and shift operations, as depicted in the subsequent figure. This will eliminate runtime reordering overheads and improve performance.

## Download and Deploy Models from our Model Zoo

We offer a selection of models that have been tested with TinyChatEngine. These models can be readily downloaded and deployed on your device. To download a model, locate the target model's ID in the table below and use the associated script.
